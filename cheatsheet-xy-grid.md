The Foundation XY Grid System is a 12 column grid system based on Flexbox. 

The flex grid has 12 spaces/cells per row.  Going over 12 measures means that items will wrap underneath

SIZING COLUMNS/CELLS
CLASS NAME | WHAT IT DOES | EXAMPLE|
|---|---|---|
cell | declares a cell, full width  by default | ```<div class="cell">...</div>```
small-1 ... small-12 | specifies width for small screens |
medium-1 ... medium-12 | specifies width for medium screens |
large-1 ... large-12 | specifies width for large screens |
___NOTE___ Foundation is mobile first, that means small-size is the default for all sizes, small-12 is always implied
